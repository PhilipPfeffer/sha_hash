# Milestone 1 Submission

## Application Description: 
```bash
# Please describe the application you want to work on here
```

## Software Implementation: 
```bash
The software implementation can be found at: https://github.com/PhilipPfeffer/sha_hash/blob/main/sha.py
```

## Setup Instructions:
```bash
There are three modes on our software demo:

- If you wish to run a simple demo with a hard-coded string, simply call "python3 sha.py"
- If you wish to run the script with your own string, run "python3 sha.py -s yoursamplestring"
- If you wish to run the script with a sample .txt file, run "python3 sha.py -f yourfile.txt". We added bible.txt and small_bible.txt to the repo if you wish to try the script out with those files.

```

## Performance Analysis:
```bash
# Please add a performance analysis of your software implementation. 
# This can be an analytical analysis of the computations or from a profiling package (e.g. Tensorboard).

# Here's a list of instrumentation / profiling tools:
# C/C++: Valgrind, Callgrind.
# Python: trace, timeit
# TensorFlow: TensorBoard
# PyTorch: torch.utils.bottleneck, etc.
# CUDA: CUDA::Profiler
```
